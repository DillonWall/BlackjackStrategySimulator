## Overview
This program is a blackjack simulator and strategy creator.

One day I threw together this Python script because I was interested in testing different betting strategies for blackjack.

## Details
Contains variables for tweaking the simulation.

Allows creating 2 strategies, one is used while ahead (at a profit) and the other while behind (at a loss).

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio Code (or your Python IDE of choice)

Change the "#----PUBLIC-VARIABLES----#" and "#-----STRATEGY-SETUP-----#" sections as needed

## Status
This project is finished.
